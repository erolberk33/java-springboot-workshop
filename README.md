# Java Spring Boot Workshop â€“ Participant Summary (2-Day Workshop)

This README summarizes the knowledge I gained during a two-day intensive Java Spring Boot workshop. The program consisted of four sessions in total: two sessions per day, each lasting two hours. The content progressed from Java fundamentals to Spring Boot RESTful APIs and OpenAI integration.

## ðŸ”¹ Session 1 â€“ Java Basics & Data Handling

We began with the fundamentals of the Java programming language. The session included setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK) and configuring an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) for efficient development.

We explored primitive data types (int, boolean, double, etc.), variable declarations, scope, and lifetime. Type conversion (casting) was coveredâ€”for example, converting a `double` to an `int`. We also learned about Java operators: arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

The session concluded with hands-on exercises and Q&A to solidify our understanding of these core concepts.

## ðŸ”¹ Session 2 â€“ Conditionals, Loops & Collections

This session focused on adding logic to programs through conditional statements like `if-else` and `switch`.

We explored various loop structures including `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `foreach`, and discussed when to use each.

Then we were introduced to the Java Collections Framework, focusing on `List`, `Set`, and `Map` interfaces. We reviewed their use cases and tried basic implementation examples.

We also learned the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**. A small guided project helped us apply these principles in practice.

## ðŸ”¹ Session 3 â€“ Getting Started with Spring Boot

We created our first Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr. We learned how Spring Boot simplifies configuration and speeds up development using its starter dependencies.

We were introduced to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and its components. We practiced building `@RestController` classes and handling client requests using annotations like `@GetMapping`.

The concept of three-tier architecture (Controller â€“ Service â€“ Repository) was explained and implemented in a simple web service.

## ðŸ”¹ Session 4 â€“ OpenAI API Integration

The final session introduced AI integration. We learned how to create an OpenAI account, obtain an API key, and navigate the official API documentation.

We used `RestTemplate` to send HTTP requests from our Spring Boot project, practicing GET, POST, and other HTTP methods. We simulated making requests to an AI model and receiving dynamic responses.

Best practices for API integration were sharedâ€”such as authentication, error handling, and clean API design.
